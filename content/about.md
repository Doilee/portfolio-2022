I am dedicated to creating modern and intuitive web applications that improve society and our world. I have extensive experience with Laravel and Vue.js, two powerful tools that I use to build dynamic and interactive websites.

My skills extend beyond just Laravel and Vue.js. I also have experience with Docker, Typescript, Redis, SEO optimization, DevOps, PHPUnit tests, and Go. 

I also happen to be a vegan and am committed to doing work that helps improve society and our world. I believe that we all have a responsibility to take care of the planet and its inhabitants, and I strive to use my skills to make a positive impact.
