Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who thinks like a product person. Over the past decade, Iâ€™ve worked on complex systems, led technical rebuilds, and launched products from the ground up. What drives me most is solving real problems with clean, thoughtful solutions.

I care less about methodologies and more about whether something actually delivers value. For instance Agile, TDD, OOP, SOLID are technologies Iâ€™ve worked with extensively, and Iâ€™ll use them if they help. But I wonâ€™t blindly follow a process that adds more noise than clarity. I believe in simplicity, efficiency, and building things that make sense, both technically and logically.

in 2024, I co-founded Worn Out Vegan, a sustainable e-commerce brand with a message. I built the store, designed the workflows, automated the backend, ran the marketing stack, and sharpened my understanding of what makes a product resonate. Running a business changes how you think as a developer. You stop seeing features as tasks and start seeing them as little assets.

I love projects that bring energy. A smart team, a meaningful challenge, or an idea I can stand behind. I like working with people who know what theyâ€™re doing, or who are open enough to trust me when I do. Iâ€™ve got a lot to offer, and I donâ€™t need to be managed into greatness. Just pointed in the right direction.

What I wonâ€™t do: high-stress chaos for things I donâ€™t believe in. Iâ€™ve seen what happens when teams chase trends, rewrite everything, or fall in love with their own abstractions. Itâ€™s expensive, demoralizing, and typically very avoidable.

I build with clarity and care. No unnecessary rewrites, no endless delays, no architecture just for the sake of it. Just software that works, and a developer whoâ€™s quietly thinking two steps ahead.
