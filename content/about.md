I am dedicated to creating modern and intuitive web applications that improve society and our world. I have extensive experience with Laravel and Vue.js, two powerful tools that I use to build dynamic and interactive websites.

With Laravel, I am able to quickly and efficiently develop custom web applications that are scalable and secure. This versatile PHP framework provides me with the necessary tools and features to build a wide range of applications, from simple websites to complex e-commerce platforms.

In addition to Laravel, I also have experience working with Vue.js to create interactive and engaging user interfaces. This awesome JavaScript framework allows me to easily create dynamic and reactive components that enhance the user experience.

My skills extend beyond just Laravel and Vue.js. I also have experience with Docker, Typescript, Redis, SEO optimization, DevOps, PHPUnit tests, and Go. 

My knowledge of SEO allows me to ensure that my websites are easily discoverable by search engines (namely Google), and my familiarity with DevOps and unit testing allows me to develop high-quality applications that are robust and reliable. I also have experience with Go, which allows me to develop (energy) efficient and scalable backend services.

I also happen to be a vegan and am committed to doing work that helps improve society and our world. I believe that we all have a responsibility to take care of the planet and its inhabitants, and I strive to use my skills to make a positive impact.
